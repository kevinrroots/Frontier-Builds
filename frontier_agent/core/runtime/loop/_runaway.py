# ── Reasoning-runaway detection (capped-empty completions) ───────────
#
# Some reasoning models behind OpenAI-compatible gateways can burn the entire
# ``max_tokens`` budget inside
# the reasoning channel and return a *successful* response with zero
# visible content and no tool calls (``finish_reason="length"``).
# ``call_llm`` treats that signature as retriable-same-key. The very first
# runaway switches the retry to a reduced ``max_tokens`` and appends a
# transient, throwaway reminder asking for concise reasoning plus visible
# output/tool use. The reminder never enters durable message history.
# If the retry budget is exhausted the response is returned as-is so the
# loop's existing no-tool nudge stays the behavioural floor — a runaway must
# never escalate into a fatal ``llm_error`` stop past turn 1.

_RUNAWAY_MIN_OUTPUT_TOKENS = 1024
# Ceiling for retry caps after a confirmed runaway. The actual bound cap
# is derived from the observed completion usage so low-cap profiles
# (e.g. CI smoke at 1024) are not accidentally raised to this value.
_RUNAWAY_RETRY_MAX_TOKENS = 8192
# The reminder rides as a ``user`` turn, NOT a trailing ``system`` one.
# Providers disagree on non-leading system messages: the Anthropic adapter
# only lifts a LEADING system message out of the array
# (``anthropic_client._split_system``) and maps anything else through the
# ``{"role": "user"}`` fallthrough, and reasoning-model chat templates on
# SGLang/vLLM commonly render only the first system block. A user turn means
# every provider sees the same instruction in the same position.
