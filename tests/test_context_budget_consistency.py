"""The three token budgets must be able to hold at once.

`config/sglang/README.md` describes the context/output relationship and
`docker/sglang-doctor.sh` checks it — but only for `SGLANG_*` on the compose
path, by a script an operator has to remember to run. The values that actually
build the loop are the profile's `max_len` / `max_input_tokens` and the LLM's
`max_tokens`, and those can be set straight through `OPENAI_*` against any
endpoint with nothing checking them.

A violation does not look like a misconfiguration. It surfaces as a provider
rejection mid-run, or as a reasoning watchdog that cannot reliably pre-empt the
provider's output cap — both of which read as runtime faults.
