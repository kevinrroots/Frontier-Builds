"""Where apodex's ``bash`` actually runs.

Four strategies, resolved once at startup:

``native``
    The default for Linux host installs. Commands run as the current host user,
    while mutable runtime state and package-manager caches live below
    ``<workspace>/.apodex/runtime/native``. This is a convenience boundary, not an OS
    security boundary.

``bwrap``
    An explicit Linux isolation option. The command runs inside a bubblewrap
    jail: the working directory is bound read-write **at its own path**, the
    system is read-only, and the rest of ``$HOME`` is not in the mount
    namespace at all. Path identity matters — the model writes
    ``/home/me/repo/src/x.py`` and that is the same file inside and outside,
    so its paths, tracebacks and diffs all line up.

``host``
    No namespace: the command runs as you, in your working directory. This is
    what the interactive approval gate was designed around, but a mistake the
    gate approves has your whole filesystem in reach. Requires an explicit
    opt-in, because silently degrading a sandbox is how you end up believing
    in a boundary that is not there.

``container``
    We are already inside a container the CLI launched (macOS path, see
    :mod:`apodex.docker`). The container *is* the boundary; nesting bwrap
    inside it buys nothing and most container runtimes forbid it anyway.

Order of resolution: explicit argument → configured backend (``APODEX_SANDBOX``
or ``SANDBOX_BACKEND``) → in-container marker → native marker → Linux native
default. macOS is normally handled by the CLI's Docker-or-native selection
before this resolver is called.

``SANDBOX_BACKEND`` is read here as well as by :mod:`plugins.tools._sandbox`
precisely so the two layers cannot disagree: a process told "bubblewrap jail"
in the banner must not execute through the native backend, and our own compose
files configure the boundary with that variable.
